Any information you think we should know about your submission
* Is there anything that doesn't work? Why?
The API is limited to ~100 requests per day, and also frequently just isn't working, so if the pages aren't loading that could be the problem.
Also, one of our laptops (a Mac) would laternate between being willing to connect to firebase and not on a given day with no code changes. It always worked on my Linux desktop, and worked all of the time on our Windows laptop, so I'm not sure what is going on here but I'm assuming this is an android studio on mac issue.
* Is there anything that you did that you feel might be unclear? Explain it here.
